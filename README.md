## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS variables for colors
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- https://autoprefixer.github.io/
- axe DevTools for accessibility

### What I learned

I solidified my mobile-first approach. Praticed using flexbox and rem units. Introduced CSS variables for colors.

### Continued development

I want to keep on using CSS variables from here on out. That way when I get into more of the advanced challenges, this will come in hand for quickly adjusting light or dark mode functionality on the challenge content.
